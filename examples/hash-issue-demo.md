# git-issue: Hash-Based Issue IDs Demo

Demonstration of the new git-native issue tracking with hash-based IDs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Our issue tracker now uses git-style 7-character hash IDs instead of sequential numbers:
- **Old way**: `#47`, `#48`, `#49`
- **New way**: `#a064d35`, `#413307f`, `#b2c5e8a`

## ðŸš€ Demo Commands

### Create Issues (New Hash-Based)
```bash
# Auto-generates hash IDs
git issue create "Fix navbar responsive design"
# âœ“ Created issue #b2c5e8a: Fix navbar responsive design

git issue create "Add dark mode toggle"  
# âœ“ Created issue #7f3d1a9: Add dark mode toggle
```

### Legacy Support
```bash
# Still works for backwards compatibility
git issue add custom-id "Manual ID issue"
# Note: 'add' is deprecated, use 'create' for auto-generated hash IDs
# âœ“ Created issue #custom-id: Manual ID issue
```

### Standard Operations with Hash IDs
```bash
# Update issue state
git issue update b2c5e8a state in-progress

# Add comments
git issue comment b2c5e8a "Started responsive breakpoint work"

# Link to commits
git commit -m "Fix navbar mobile layout"
git issue link b2c5e8a HEAD

# View details
git issue show b2c5e8a

# Status overview
git issue-status
```

## ðŸ“Š Current Issues

Here's our current issue list showing the mix of hash and legacy IDs:

```

## ðŸŽ‰ Benefits

### âœ… **Developer Familiar**
- Hash IDs look like commit hashes: `a064d35`
- Natural for git users
- Easy to type and autocomplete

### âœ… **Zero Conflicts**
- Globally unique hash generation
- No more "issue #47 already exists"
- Perfect for distributed teams

### âœ… **Git Integration**
- Leverages git's proven hash system
- Works with existing git tools
- Feels like native git feature

### âœ… **Optimal Length**
- Shorter than UUIDs (7 vs 36 chars)
- Longer than sequential (7 vs 2-3 chars)
- Expandable if collisions (rare)

## ðŸ”— Git Integration Example

```bash
# Create issue
git issue create "Fix login validation"
# âœ“ Created issue #d4a2b89: Fix login validation

# Work on the fix
git checkout -b fix-login-validation
echo "// Better validation logic" >> login.js
git add login.js
git commit -m "Improve login validation logic"

# Link issue to commit  
git issue link d4a2b89 HEAD

# View in git log
git log --notes --oneline -1
# abc1234 Improve login validation logic
# Notes:
#     Issue: #d4a2b89
#     Thoughts: Linked to issue #d4a2b89
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Migration Path

The system supports both hash and legacy IDs during transition:

1. **New issues**: Use `create` command for hash IDs
2. **Existing issues**: Continue working with old numeric IDs  
3. **Legacy support**: `add` command still works but shows deprecation warning
4. **Future**: Can migrate old IDs to hash format if needed

This makes our issue tracker feel like a **native git extension** while solving all distributed collaboration challenges! ðŸš€
