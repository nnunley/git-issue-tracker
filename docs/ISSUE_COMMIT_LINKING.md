# Issue-Commit Linking

This document describes how to link commits to issues using git-issue, providing full traceability between code changes and issue resolution.

## Overview

git-issue creates bidirectional links between issues and commits using git notes, maintaining a complete audit trail without modifying commit history.

### Key Benefits
- **Full traceability**: See which commits address which issues
- **Audit trail**: Complete history of links and changes
- **Non-invasive**: Doesn't modify commit SHAs or messages
- **Searchable**: Find commits by issue or issues by commit
- **Version controlled**: All links are versioned in git

## Quick Start

### Link a Commit to an Issue
```bash
# Link commit a3380db to issue #213
git issue link 213 a3380db
```

This creates:
- Comment in issue #213 showing the linked commit
- Git note on commit a3380db referencing issue #213

### View Linked Information
```bash
# Show commits with their issue links
git log --notes --oneline -10

# Show specific commit with issue context
git show --notes a3380db

# View all commits linked to an issue
git issue show 213
```

## üìã Detailed Usage

### Creating Links

**Link during development:**
```bash
# After making a commit that addresses an issue
git commit -m "refactor: Improve UI component structure"
git issue link 213 HEAD
```

**Link existing commits:**
```bash
# Link specific commit hash
git issue link 102 9d5b93a

# Link multiple commits to same issue
git issue link 102 abc123
git issue link 102 def456
```

### Viewing Relationships

**Issue-centric view:**
```bash
# See all commits for an issue
git issue show 213

# Output shows:
# id: 213
# title: Create UI Kit abstraction layer
# ...
# [2025-07-12T16:08:49Z] System: Linked to commit: a3380db
```

**Commit-centric view:**
```bash
# Show commit with issue context
git show --notes a3380db

# Shows both commit details and note:
# Notes:
#     Issue: #213 (UI Kit abstraction layer)
#     Thoughts: This cleanup focused on semantic HTML...
#     Date: 2025-07-12 12:08:49
#     Author: Norman Nunley, Jr
```

**Full history view:**
```bash
# Show recent commits with all notes
git log --notes --oneline -10

# Show detailed notes
git log --notes --format=fuller -5
```

### Searching and Analysis

**Find commits by issue:**
```bash
# Search git log for issue references
git log --notes --grep="#213" --all

# Search across all note content
git log --notes -S "issue #213" --all
```

**Find issues by commit:**
```bash
# Search issue tracker for specific commit
git issue search "a3380db"
```

**Historical analysis:**
```bash
# See when links were created
git log --oneline refs/notes/commits

# Track evolution of specific issue
git log --oneline refs/notes/issue-213
```

## üîß Advanced Features

### Batch Operations

**Link multiple commits to one issue:**
```bash
# Link a series of commits to the same issue
for commit in abc123 def456 ghi789; do
    git issue link 102 $commit
done
```

**Link one commit to multiple issues:**
```bash
# If a commit addresses multiple issues
git issue link 102 abc123
git issue link 103 abc123
```

### Integration with Workflow

**During development:**
```bash
# 1. Start working on an issue
git issue update 213 state in-progress

# 2. Make commits as normal
git commit -m "refactor: Extract common UI patterns"

# 3. Link commits as you go
git issue link 213 HEAD

# 4. Add progress comments
git issue comment 213 "Completed semantic HTML improvements"

# 5. Mark complete when done
git issue update 213 state done
```

**Code review integration:**
```bash
# During review, see all commits for an issue
git issue show 213

# Review specific commit with issue context
git show --notes abc123
```

## üìä Reporting and Analysis

### Generate Reports

**Issue completion tracking:**
```bash
# See which issues have linked commits (active work)
for issue in $(git issue list | grep -o '#[0-9]*'); do
    echo "=== Issue $issue ==="
    git issue show ${issue#\#} | grep "Linked to commit"
done
```

**Commit coverage:**
```bash
# Find commits without issue links
git log --oneline --since="1 week ago" | while read commit msg; do
    if ! git notes show $commit 2>/dev/null | grep -q "Issue:"; then
        echo "Unlinked: $commit $msg"
    fi
done
```

### Quality Metrics

**Development velocity:**
```bash
# Count commits per issue over time
git log --notes --since="1 month ago" --format="%H %ad" --date=short | \
while read commit date; do
    issue=$(git notes show $commit 2>/dev/null | grep "Issue:" | head -1)
    echo "$date: $issue"
done | sort | uniq -c
```

## üîÑ Synchronization and Backup

### Backup Links
```bash
# Push all issue notes to remote
git push origin refs/notes/*

# Or push specific note refs
git push origin refs/notes/commits refs/notes/issue-*
```

### Restore Links
```bash
# Fetch all notes from remote
git fetch origin refs/notes/*:refs/notes/*

# Configure automatic note syncing
git config --add remote.origin.fetch +refs/notes/*:refs/notes/*
```

### Team Collaboration
```bash
# Before starting work, pull latest notes
git fetch origin refs/notes/*:refs/notes/*

# After linking commits, push notes
git push origin refs/notes/commits refs/notes/issue-*
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Issue not found" error:**
```bash
# Check if issue exists
git issue list | grep "#213"

# Create issue if missing
git issue add 213 "Issue title"
```

**"Invalid commit" error:**
```bash
# Verify commit exists
git rev-parse abc123

# Use correct commit hash
git log --oneline -5
```

**Notes not showing:**
```bash
# Configure git to show notes by default
git config notes.displayRef refs/notes/commits
git config notes.displayRef refs/notes/issue-*

# Or explicitly request notes
git log --notes
```

### Cleaning Up

**Remove broken links:**
```bash
# Edit issue to remove bad commit reference
git issue show 213
# Manually edit if needed

# Remove note from commit
git notes remove abc123
```

**Reorganize links:**
```bash
# Move link from one issue to another
git issue link 214 abc123  # Add to new issue
# Then manually remove from old issue
```

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Link early and often** - Don't wait until the end to create links
2. **Use meaningful commit messages** - Even with links, clear messages help
3. **Update issue status** - Keep issues current as you make progress
4. **Add context comments** - Explain complex relationships
5. **Review links during code review** - Ensure traceability is maintained
6. **Backup notes regularly** - Push to remote to avoid losing links
